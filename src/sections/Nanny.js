          Are you feeling overwhelmed and noticing that your child or children are needing more support? Most parents
          and children need extra support. I can provide the support and co-regulation that children need to feel safe
          and to be able to learn to be more cooperative and grow. When the body feels safe, the brain comes on line and
          can think more clearly! This is helpful for the whole family, and I as a nanny seek to support not only the
          children, but the parents as well.

          I have been a kind, generous and loving nanny and babysitter for over 10 years. I practice loving boundaries,
          with words that acknowledge your children as their own unique, beautiful beings. I am all about facilitating a
          space for kids and families to feel safe, and come into their individual and positive traits.

          I studied Child Development in Undergrad, and will be specializing in Marriage and Family Therapy as I become
          a Licensed Therapist in the next few years. I am First Aid and CPR trained, as creating a safe space for your
          children is number one, with learning and fun being important as well.
