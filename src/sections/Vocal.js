          Are you someone that’s excited or anxious about singing but have never gotten the support you’ve needed to
          grow your inner and outer voice? Freeing your vocal chords can actually assist in reducing anxiety and
          depression, and help to increase self-confidence. Working with your body to access your inner voice also helps
          you access your inner resilience and creativity.

          I have been a singer since before I was born! I absolutely love singing and holding a space for clients to
          grow and come into their unique vocal expression. I incorporate Psycho-Spiritual methodologies to enhance
          self-confidence. The main key to singing from the Soul is accessing your inner truth from within, and freeing
          your expression. We work on this lovingly.
